## This project is under development üèóÔ∏è

Status: **Alpha**

At this current time, the project is under heavy development work. You are able to use it through https://theopenpresenter.com and I personally use it every week. However, use at your own risk as things might break.

### Developer wiki

We maintain a separate wiki page at https://docs.theopenpresenter.com. Please refer to this site for anything technical relating this project. If anything is unclear or missing, please do contact us and we'll try our best to explain it better.

## What is TheOpenPresenter?

**Our mission is to provide the most user-friendly solution to present any media in a church setting.**

‚úÖ Present in any device that can run a browser  
‚úÖ Collaborate & control presentation from anywhere  
‚úÖ Play video from various sources (Youtube, local, etc)  
‚úÖ Organize your past and future presentation sessions   
‚úÖ Record audio and save it for future playback  
üü® Import & display lyrics from various sources with ease (currently only MyWorshipList)  
üü® Display slides from many different sources (currently only Powerpoint, Google Slides and PDFs)  
üü® Offline app support - Alpha (currently only for Windows)  

Last but not least, the code for TheOpenPresenter will always be Open Source. We also promise to keep a hosted version of TheOpenPresenter free for small churches for as long as possible, the ones that will benefit from this project the most.

### Who is it for?

If you regularly present slides or lyrics to a congregation - no matter how small or big it is, TheOpenPresenter is for you. 

However, do note that this project is build with the focus on smaller congregations. As such, more advanced features might take land futher on in the development cycle.

## Every Contribution Makes a Difference

We welcome contributions of any kind, including blog posts, tutorials, translations, testing, writing documentation, and pull requests. Our [Developer Wiki](https://docs.theopenpresenter.com) contains all the information necessary for you to get started.

## Thank you, open source

TheOpenPresenter makes use of numerous open-source projects and we are deeply grateful. We hope that by offering TheOpenPresenter as a free, open-source project, we can help others in the same way these programs have helped us.

We would like to particularly thank [graphile/starter](https://github.com/graphile/starter) as this repo started from there. Many of the features here would have taken much longer otherwise.

This project is tested with BrowserStack
