# ![logo](./public/logo_dark.png =48x48) TheOpenPresenter

**TheOpenPresenter** is an ambitious project aiming to be the final presenter software you'll ever need.
It achieves this through its modular architecture, allowing for endless customization and feature based on every specific needs.

## This project is under development üèóÔ∏è

At this current time, you will not see anything substantial here. However, this README will serve as a document to align the goals and vision of the project.

## Goals

### 1. Web-based

Most, if not all of the projection software available today is distributed as an app. With the way technology are progressing today, there is no reason why it can't be a simple web page.

An event organizer should be able to open a link and start presenting right away. Think Google slides, but much more powerful.

### 2. Cloud powered & Collaborative

One desirable feature from software available today is collaboration. Imagine again Google slides. You can work on the same slide at the same time. Why not have the same here? 

Someone could prepare the announcements slides while the other prepare the lyrics and so on.

Or if it's a multi-day event, you could prepare everything in advance directly in TheOpenPresenter. On the day, all you need to do is open the webpage.

### 3. Available as a local app

With that in mind, not every venue has access to internet. And even if they do, it's not always reliable. So TheOpenPresenter should also be available as a local app. Syncing to the cloud when possible.

### 4. Modular & Powerful

Most feature should be available as plugins. There are so many use-cases for a presentation software. We can't possibly do them all here. Instead, we try to be as modular as possible so that plugin developers can extend it to fit their use case.

### 5. Focused

TheOpenPresenter is first and foremost designed to be used in a church setting. As such, it needs to be suited to that use case. It should also be easy to use and volunteer friendly.

The modular approach of this project should complement this goal by only showing as much as needed for each church's use-case.
