# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability with the TheOpenPresenter codebase, you can disclose it responsibly by sending a summary to security@theopenpresenter.com.
We will review the potential threat and fix it as fast as we can.

While we do not have a bounty program in place yet, we are incredibly thankful for people who take the time to share their findings with us. Whether it's a tiny bug that you've found or a security vulnerability, all reports help us to continuously improve TheOpenPresenter for everyone. Thank you!
